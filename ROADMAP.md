# RPG Lesson: Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development plan for the RPG OOP demonstration project, now organized into a modular package structure that demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts.

## Current Status (v0.3.0)

**Completed**:
- [x] Refactored codebase into a modular package structure
- [x] Separated concerns into logical modules:
  - [x] `character.py`: Character and Boss classes (inheritance)
  - [x] `weapon.py`: Weapon class (composition)
  - [x] `game.py`: Main game loop and state management
  - [x] `game_logger.py`: Combat logging (association)
  - [x] `utils.py`: Helper functions
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation and type hints
- [x] Improved error handling and input validation
- [x] Updated CHANGELOG.md with all changes

## Next Steps

### 1. Game Features (Current Focus)
- [ ] Add character inventory system
- [ ] Implement experience and leveling system
- [ ] Add more enemy types with unique abilities
- [ ] Create different weapon types and rarities
- [ ] Add special abilities and skills
- [ ] Implement a combat status effect system

### 2. Enhanced Gameplay
- [ ] Add quest system with objectives
- [ ] Implement day/night cycle
- [ ] Add NPCs with dialogue trees
- [ ] Create multiple game areas/maps



### 3. Code Quality & Documentation
- [ ] Add more detailed docstrings
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
- [ ] Create API documentation using Sphinx
- [ ] Add more comprehensive type hints and static type checking

### 4. Advanced Features (Future)
- [ ] Save/load game functionality
- [ ] Multiple game difficulty levels
- [ ] Player achievements system
- [ ] Sound effects and music

### Archived: Testing Implementation
- [x] Created `tests/` directory with unit tests for each module
- [x] Implemented test coverage reporting
- [x] Set up pytest configuration
- [x] Added test fixtures and mocks
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing (Deferred)
- [ ] Add integration tests for game flow (Deferred)

## Project Structure

```
rpg_oop_concepts/
├── __init__.py
├── character.py     # Character and Boss classes
├── weapon.py        # Weapon class
├── game.py         # Main Game class
├── game_logger.py  # GameLogger class
└── utils.py        # Utility functions
main.py            # Entry point
```

## Learning Objectives Covered

### OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- [x] **Inheritance**: `Boss` extends `Character`
- [x] **Composition**: `Character` contains `Weapon`
- [x] **Encapsulation**: Private attributes with getters/setters
- [x] **Polymorphism**: Overridden `attack` method in `Boss`
- [x] **Association**: `Game` uses `GameLogger`

### Code Organization
- [x] Clear separation of concerns
- [x] Modular design for better maintainability
- [x] Consistent code style and documentation
- [x] Error handling and input validation

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize critical sections
2. **Modular Design**: Consider using interfaces/abstract base classes
3. **Extensibility**: Design for easy addition of new features
4. **User Experience**: Improve game feedback and controls

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5. Open a Pull Request
